# Feature Specification: Ghost CMS Management CLI (ghostctl)

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-cli`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a CLI named \"ghostctl\" that can fully manage a Ghost CMS blog via the Admin API: posts/pages CRUD (draft/publish/schedule, feature image upload, tags/authors), tags CRUD, members CRUD (labels), newsletters CRUD, tiers & offers CRUD, webhooks CRUD, images upload, themes upload/activate/rollback, content export/import, and selected settings read/update.

The CLI must support:
- Profiles via ~/.ghostctl.toml and env vars (GHOST_API_URL, GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY, GHOST_API_VERSION).
- Output formats: table|json|yaml.
- Bulk operations (CSV/JSON).
- Dry-run and idempotency flags.
- Great help text and examples.

Deliver: production-quality code, tests, and docs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Ghost blog administrator, I need a command-line tool that allows me to manage all aspects of my Ghost CMS blog without using the web interface, so that I can automate content management tasks, perform bulk operations efficiently, and integrate Ghost management into my existing workflows and scripts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a configured ghostctl profile with valid credentials, **When** the user runs `ghostctl posts list`, **Then** the tool displays all posts in the default table format
2. **Given** a draft post exists, **When** the user runs `ghostctl posts publish <post-id>`, **Then** the post status changes to published and confirmation is displayed
3. **Given** a CSV file with multiple member records, **When** the user runs `ghostctl members import members.csv`, **Then** all valid members are created and a summary report is shown
4. **Given** an active theme, **When** the user runs `ghostctl themes rollback`, **Then** the previous theme version is activated and the current one is deactivated
5. **Given** the dry-run flag is set, **When** the user runs any modification command, **Then** the tool shows what would happen without making actual changes
6. **Given** multiple profiles exist, **When** the user runs `ghostctl --profile staging posts list`, **Then** the tool uses the staging profile credentials
7. **Given** a network failure occurs, **When** the user runs any command, **Then** the tool displays a clear error message with retry suggestions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when API rate limits are exceeded? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retry strategy and backoff policy not specified]
- How does system handle partial bulk operation failures?
- What happens when trying to rollback with no previous theme version?
- How does the tool handle concurrent modifications from web interface?
- What happens when credentials expire mid-operation?
- How are large content exports handled? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: size limits and streaming approach not specified]
